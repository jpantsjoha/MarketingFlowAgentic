# ADR-003: High-Level Agent Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Based on our business strategy of autonomous content generation, we need a system architecture that is modular, scalable, and incorporates quality gates directly into the workflow. The design must break down the complex task of campaign creation into manageable, specialized components.

## Decision

We will implement a sequential, multi-layer agent pipeline orchestrated by a root `SequentialAgent`. This pipeline explicitly defines the flow of work from ideation to final prioritization.

The pipeline consists of the following stages:
1.  **Parallel Ideation Layer (`ParallelAgent`):** Four specialized agents (`TrendAgent`, `CommunityAgent`, `ContentAgent`, `BrandAgent`) run concurrently to generate diverse ideas based on the initial business intent.
2.  **Synthesis Layer (`Agent`):** A strategist agent receives the outputs from the ideation layer and synthesizes them into a single, cohesive campaign brief.
3.  **Validation Layer (`Agent`):** A brand assurance agent acts as a quality gate, reviewing the synthesized brief against brand guidelines and outputting a structured validation report (pass/fail with recommendations).
4.  **Queueing Layer (`Agent`):** A queueing agent analyzes the validated brief to assign a distribution priority based on a predefined matrix, preparing it for the subsequent distribution phase.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- **Modularity:** Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
- **Separation of Concerns:** The pipeline clearly separates idea generation from synthesis, validation, and queuing.
- **Built-in Quality Control:** The `BrandAssuranceAgent` ensures that no content proceeds without meeting brand standards.
- **Reliability:** The use of structured, Pydantic-validated data passed between agents minimizes errors and ensures a predictable workflow.

**Negative:**
- **Sequential Latency:** The total time for the workflow is the sum of the latencies of each sequential step (though the parallel ideation step optimizes its own stage).
- **Complexity:** The multi-agent design introduces a level of complexity that requires careful management and observability.
