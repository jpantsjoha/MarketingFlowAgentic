# ADR-001: Autonomous Marketing Content Generation

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The current process for creating and distributing marketing content is manual and time-consuming. To accelerate and scale our marketing efforts while maintaining high standards of brand consistency and quality, we need a more efficient system.

## Decision

We will build an autonomous, AI-powered marketing system focused on **generating visual assets** for a hypothetical apparel shop. The system will take a high-level business intent (e.g., "launch a new collection"), use baseline product images as references, and automate the workflow of creating marketing concepts, generating simulated visual content (images and videos), and drafting social media posts for platforms like X/Twitter.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- **Increased Velocity:** Significantly reduces the time required to launch new marketing campaigns.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** Allows for a higher volume of content production without a linear increase in manual effort.
- **Improved Consistency:** Enforces brand guidelines automatically, ensuring a consistent voice and narrative across all platforms.
- **Strategic Focus:** Frees up the marketing team to focus on high-level strategy, performance analysis, and creative direction rather than operational tasks.

**Negative:**
- **Initial Investment:** Requires an upfront development effort to build and train the agentic workflow.
- **Operational Oversight:** The system will require ongoing monitoring and fine-tuning to ensure optimal performance and alignment with evolving brand strategy.
